# get-pr-info

This composite action is intended to be used in workflows that run on `pull-request/<PR_NUMBER>` branches.

It will extract the pull-request number from the branch name and use it to fetch information about the corresponding pull-request from GitHub's API.

The JSON object returned by this composite action is described here: [https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request).
