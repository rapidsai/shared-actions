description: |
  Wrapper that clones a specific branch/ref of the shared-actions repo, then
  calls the `load-base-env-vars` action to download the base environment
  variables and load them into the current environment.

  This does not overwrite any environment variables that are already set.
inputs:
  load_service_name:
    description: |
      If true, loads OTEL_SERVICE_NAME from the stashed env vars. This is used for top-level workflows.
      Otherwise the telemetry service name is obtained from Github job metadata.
      Getting the service name from Github job metadata is for child workflows.
