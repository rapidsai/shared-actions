description: |
  Clones a particular branch/ref of a shared-actions repo, then
  call the stash-base-env-vars implementation script, which writes
  some environment variables so that downstream jobs can refer to them.

  Inputs here are all assumed to be env vars set outside of this script.
  Set them in your main repo's workflows.

runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - name: Clone shared-actions repo
      if: ${{ env.TELEMETRY_ENABLED == 'true' }}
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        repository: ${{ env.SHARED_ACTIONS_REPO || 'rapidsai/shared-actions' }}
        ref: ${{ env.SHARED_ACTIONS_REF || 'main' }}
        path: ./shared-actions
