description: |
  Clones a particular branch/ref of a shared-actions repo, then
  call the stash-artifacts implementation script, which writes
  some environment variables so that downstream jobs can refer to them.

  Inputs here are all assumed to be env vars set outside of this script.
  Set them in your main repo's workflows (export to ${GITHUB_ENV}!!)

runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - uses: rapidsai/shared-actions/telemetry-impls/load-then-clone@better-download-error-handling
    # Stash current job's OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES and any files in the telemetry-artifacts directory
    - name: Stash job artifacts
      uses: ./shared-actions/telemetry-impls/stash-job-artifacts
