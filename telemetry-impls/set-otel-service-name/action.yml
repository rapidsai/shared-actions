    Set OTEL_SERVICE_NAME from github job info

    OTEL_SERVICE_NAME is a special environment variable that represents a job for us.
    Each different OTEL_SERVICE_NAME is represented by a different color when looking at the trace
    in Grafana. We have different OTEL_SERVICE_NAME for each different job, as
    well as each matrix configuration of jobs that have matrices.

    Obtains GitHub Actions job list and matches current job using runner name and attempt number.
    Returns name of current workflow, which will include any matrix components
    Sets the OTEL_SERVICE_NAME environment variable. Output is also here if you prefer.
outputs:
  name:
    description: 'The name of the job matching the current runner name and attempt number'
    value: ${{ steps.get-job-name.outputs.JOB_NAME }}
